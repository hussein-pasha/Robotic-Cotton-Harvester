# RGB images of cotton bolls and YOLOv4-tiny training weights
This repository includes three datasets used to train YOLOv4-tiny network for cotton boll detection. Each dataset contains images, labels, and the best training weight that was used during tests.
1) 2021-lab dataset contains images gathered in our lab at ABE Department in Mississippi State University during the year 2021. The trained weights were used during lab tests in 2021.
2) 2022-09-03-field dataset contains images gathered from the field. The training results was not used for lab tests.
3) 2022-10-18 dataset contains images gathered from the field while there was a black background behind the target row. The training weight was used during field tests in 2022.
